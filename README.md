Spotify clone
Developed a Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
1.	User Interface: I designed a responsive and visually appealing user interface using HTML and CSS. The layout closely resembles to Spotify's design.
2.	Playlists: Users can create and manage their playlists. I developed functionality to add or remove songs from playlists.
3.	Music Player Controls: The music player includes controls for play, pause, skip forward or backward, and adjust volume. I used JavaScript to handle these actions and ensure smooth playback.
4.	Song Information: The application displays album artwork, song title, artist name, and other relevant information for each track. This enhances the user experience and provides a visually engaging interface.
5.	Responsive Design: The Spotify clone is responsive, allowing users to access and enjoy their music on devices like laptop and mobile phones.
